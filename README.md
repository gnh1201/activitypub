## Thirdparties
* [NILFS2](https://nilfs.sourceforge.io/en/about_nilfs.html)
  * When applied to the cache area, you can benefit from improved cache write and read speeds.
* [Cloudflare WARP (Zero Trust)](https://one.one.one.one/ )
  * You can benefit from improved data transfer (federation) speeds between different nodes.
* [Cloudflare Tunnel (Argo Smart Routing)](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
  * You can benefit from improved data transfer (federation) speeds between different nodes as well as website response speeds.
* [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/ko-kr/developer-platform/r2/)
  * As an object storage service, it offers various applications. In my case, I use it to share server settings (certificates, configuration files, etc.) between servers.
* [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh)
  * SSL certificate issuance
* [squid-cache](https://www.squid-cache.org/)
  * If you're considering creating a proxy server yourself, you might want to consider squid-cache.
* Private VPN software: [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/), [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/), etc.
  * By appropriately utilizing private VPN software, you can configure network structures such as Cloud DMZ that can help in cost-saving.
* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
  * Integrate fast and explore features with 100 emails/day forever.
* [Mezmo (formerly, LogDNA)](https://www.mezmo.com/)
  * Operating a self-managed logging system may not facilitate smooth access for emergency investigation by authorities. To address such issues, external logging system operation providers can be utilized, and I recommend the company Mezmo for this purpose. Resellers such as IBM are also available.
